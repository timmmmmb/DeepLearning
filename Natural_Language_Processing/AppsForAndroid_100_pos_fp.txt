I liked the Daily verse option.  However, the DailyPlan was hard to follow.  It does the job...I will keep it.  I am back to using my hands-on Bible though.
Fun game while it lasts, but it FCs all the time with no rhyme or reason on my A500.  The only saving grace is that it sort of saves your game just before it blitzes (except for the 1 time it destroyed all my towers upon reload).  If the FC gets fixed, I'll up the stars.  It's not bad enough for 1 star, but the FCs keep it a solid 2.  Other than that, it would be a 5.
I am glad it was free when I got it because it doesn't respond its laggy and I hate it I only put a one star cause theirs no zero
We have Comcast, and when it comes to the "premium" (a matter of opinion) channels, they only list one each for HBO, Strz, etc. high definition channels. For programs in Hi Def, you have to go to "On Demand" for each of the premium channels.That may not make sense to you, but there isn't much sense about 900 channels to begin with. And that's where TV Listings for Android comes in. I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire, and up popped 900 programs for every half-hour on almost every channel we get. And THAT was great except that I don't ever watch 830 of those channels.In order to "delete" the channels that you don't watch, you have to check them off and delete them one at a time. This would rate 5 stars plus if there was a way to block, say channel 300 through 699 and delete them. After that, there's another group of 200 channels, and then I wouldn't mind picking out individual channels.Right now, even after some selection, when I want to see what's on at 9 PM, I'll get a list of 400 programs.Now, if that app would like to go a step further, I'd like to be able to delete individual programs that I will never watch ... like Tivo.
very nice app, however the reminders don't work on my Evo and I miss my shows. also this version on amazon is not the newest.
